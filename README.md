This Voting App was created to track votes for the "voter's" favorite actor.
I made a GUI in Python that shows an ID input box along with 
4 actor candidates that is tracked using csvwriter.
I gave each candidate a radio button (so 4 radio buttons total)
There's also a "submit vote" button at the bottom which saves the choice under
whichever ID is inputted in the top.

I chose this idea because it's pretty simple although can be given lots of details
to test out both complex and simple features in Python.


When converting to Java, 
I plan to hopefully test out JavaFX and see if I can use it to create a GUI eventually, although
I may just start out with a text-based interface at first, as I know absolutely nothing about JavaFX.

I plan to simplify this as much as possible when using Java, and possibly save the data in a
more simplified way as well (instead of using something like CSVwriter for example), although
I'm not sure what methods would be used to save data properly throughout multiple compiles of the same
program in Java although I'll explore those methods.

Otherwise, maybe I'll just add some fun features as well once I get comfortable with Java.
